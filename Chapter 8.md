## a. Can you explain how we can optimize and make scoring computations faster, on the adapted inverted index seen in the previous section?

## b. Do you know what inexact top-K retrieval is and why it makes sense?

## c. Can you explain a few strategies that enable an efficient implementation of inexact top-K retrieval (champion lists, impact ordering, clustering, tiered indices...)?

## d. Can you sketch a complete information retrieval architecture and its components?
