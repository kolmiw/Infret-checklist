a. Can you give the two search structures (hash index, B+-Tree) mainly used in practice for lookup up a term and its posting list in the standard inverted index?
b. Can you explain, on a logical level, what a B+-tree looks like, and explain the constraints on it?
c. Can you insert, delete and lookup a term into or from a B+-tree?
d. Do you know the difference between a B-tree and a B+-tree?
e. Can you explain why spelling mistakes are a problem in the context of information
retrieval?
f. Can you explain how wildcard queries can be executed? Can you explain why trailing
wildcards are easier?
g. Do you know what a permuterm index looks like?
h. Do you know what the k-grams (k>=2) of a word are?
i. Can you explain what a k-gram index is and how it is similar in structure to a bi-word
index?
j. Can you compute the Jaccard coefficient between two sets (expressing how close
they are, i.e., a kind of "inverse distance")?
k. Can you apply the Jaccard coefficient to the sets of k-grams (for k >=2) generated
from two words to estimate their proximity?
l. Can you explain what the edit (Levenshtein) distance between two words is?
m. Can you compute the edit distance between any two words using dynamic
programming?
n. Can you explain what the Soundex algorithm does (without knowing its details by
heart)?
o. Do you understand how the above techniques are useful to address spelling errors?
