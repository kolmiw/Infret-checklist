a. Do you know what Heap's law is and what it says (including its formula)?
b. Do you know what Zipf's law is and what it says (including its formula)?
c. Can you explain a few ways that the search structure to lookup terms can be
compressed (e.g., blocked storage, front coding)?
d. Can you explain why fixed-length encoding for posting lists (lists of document IDs) is
not optimal in practice?
e. Can you explain how this can be improved with a variable-length coding (say, with 4-
bit packets or 8-bit packets)?
f. Do you know what the unary (also called temperature) encoding is? Can you easily
encode and decode an integer with a pen and paper?
g. Do you know what the Elias Gamma Code is? Can you easily encode and decode an
integer with a pen and paper?
h. Do you know what a prefix code is? Do you know that the above three encodings are
prefix codes?
i. Do you know what a universal code is?
j. Do you know how the Elias Gamma Code does in terms of space, asymptotically?
(without knowing the deepest details on information theory or Entropy)
