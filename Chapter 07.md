## a. Can you explain how, say, a Boolean retrieval system can be extended with search on fields like title, abstract, authors (parametric search)?

## b. Can you explain how this can lead to a "primitive and simple" scoring system?

## c. Which is the model (set/list/bag of words) underlying the vector space model?

## d. Can you explain what a term frequency is, given a term and a document?

## e. Can you explain what a document frequency is, given a term?

## f. Can you explain what a collection frequency is, given a term?

## g. Can you explain how inverse document frequency (idf) is defined and why it is a better tool than "raw" document frequency?

## h. Can you easily compute the tf-idf of a term/document pair, given a collection expressed in the bag of words model?

## i. Can you explain how, in the bag of words model, documents are vectors of numbers?

## j. Can you explain why the Euclidian norm makes sense for documents?

## k. Can you renormalize a document expressed as a vector?

## l. Can you explain why the inner product between two (renormalized) documents gives a good hint on their similarity (cosine similarity)?

## m. Can you compute the inner product of two documents expressed as vectors?

## n. Can you explain why a query can also be seen as a vector of numbers?

## o. Can you explain why the inner product between a (renormalized) document and query is a good scoring system?

## p. Can you explain how the standard inverted index can be extended and adapted to support cosine similarity computation?

## q. Can you explain the difference between term-at-a-time and document-at-a-time score computation, given a query?

## r. Can you manually compute scores, given an inverted index adapted to ranked retrieval (i.e., storing precomputed idfs as well as term frequencies for each posting)?

## s. Are you familiar with the SMART notation, in particular, do you know what it expresses (you must know at least the letters n, a and b for the term frequency, n and t for the document frequency, and n and c for normalization)?
